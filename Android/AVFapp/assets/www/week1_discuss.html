		   <dl>
		   	<dt>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</dt>
               <dd>For both iOS and Android, it appears that I will be able to access the camera, contacts, accelerometer, file, geolocation, local storage, network, media, and notifications.</dd>
              
            <dt>What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</dt>
               <dd>I think, for instance, that if you were accessing the camera, you&#39;d probably want access to file, geolocation, media, and notifications.  Honestly, if you pick one element that can be accessed, there&#39;s probably some way to combine most if not all the elements into an app, and there are lots of reasons as to why you&#39;d justify putting all the elements into said app.  I think that if you were to combine them all, maybe some elements would be more important, and some would be &#39;in the background&#39;.  What I mean is, if you had a camera app, you might want direct access to geolocation and media, but alerts would be something that came as you interfaced with other elements, and not directly seen until needed.</dd>
 
            <dt>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</dt>
               <dd>I would like to work on further customizing my CSS for the AVF app, and make sure that it is catchy/pleasing to the eye.  I think that it&#39;s currently in more of a placeholder state, and I definitely want to transition out of that and into something that I consider &#39;more exciting&#39;.  I imported my CRUD app from VFW, and I want to make it look more like what I worked on last month in ASD &#45; I had more of a travel themed app, in which you could add media, etc.  I don&#39;t know if I can get all that functionality into my CRUD app, or if I&#39;ll make separate pages for those elements.  I want to try to add media access and camera access to my CRUD app if possible.</dd>
 
            <dt>Briefly describe some past &#39;lessons learned&#39; regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</dt>
               <dd>The biggest thing that I&#39;ve learned is that I have to start early and dig in until it&#39;s done.  If I try to have a marathon session in the beginning, I find that I can make great lengths in getting my project done, as opposed to having that last-minute-cram-a-thon.  I may still need a few days to complete everything, but it&#39;s SUCH A BETTER IDEA to go 110% at the start, instead of waiting.  I have found that I can pull at least one all-nighter and get so much more accomplished than if I do small segments in the afternoon.  I think it&#39;s wise to try different methods, and find your rhythm.  If you work better in the morning, make that time sacred; if better at night, make that your routine as well.  Don&#39;t deviate from what works best for you, if you can help it. </dd>
