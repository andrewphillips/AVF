		   	<dt>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</dt>
            	<dd>I think that I could incorporate very meaningful labels for all my form elements, as well as including alternative text descriptions for any graphics that I have on my site. I think having audio responses and input as an option for visually and/or mobility impaired individuals would boost the functionality for these end users. I think that the audio responses and content could be formatted into a PDF as an alternative. Many mobile and visually impaired users use a screen reader, and having that PDF format would allow the reader to read the screen out loud to them.</dd>
              
            <dt>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</dt>
               <dd>Cluttered websites full of advertisements are useless for visual & mobile impaired end users. They need to remove the clutter, as well as put into practice some sound usability and design guidelines. I think they should get rid of advertisements or move them to a spot on the page that is pre-designated for advertisements. I think that there should be hotkeys for headings and controls. Once these hotkeys are in place, they need to follow hotkey practices of all the most popular websites so that impaired users don't have to waste time re-learning a new way to navigate. Many of the popular websites already have established hotkey navigation, and impaired users are accustomed to these controls already. Websites that don't included meaningful labels for their graphics are totally non-accessible; they should include labels.</dd>
 
            <dt>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</dt>
               <dd>Two devices I've found that are made to support Accessibility are the MobilePal + GPS, and the BrailleNote mPower. The MobilePal + GPS is a phone that only has a small alarm button, as well as a large red call button. A person presses the red button and it contacts a concierge, who responds and gives them directions, calls friends or family, and will send emergency responders to the location of the individual. The MobilePal sends it's location to the concierge automatically. Currently, it seems it is being improved so that visually impaired individuals can use it for sidewalk travel directions & public transpiration details. The BrailleNote mPower converts braille documents to and from Microsoft Office documents to make things easier for visually impaired people to share information with those who are not visually impaired. It includes a QWERTY keyboard.</dd>
 
            <dt>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</dt>
               <dd>iOS provides VoiceOver installed by default in the iPhone and iPad. Another iOS app is LookTel Money Reader. This app claims it can instantly recognize currency and will say the kind audibly so visually impaired & blind people can count and identify their currency. It uses the camera and recognizes Euros, US bills, British Pounds, Australian bills, and Canadian bills.</dd>
