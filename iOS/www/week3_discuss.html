		   	<dt>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</dt>
            	<dd>From what I've read, Games are top, followed by productivity apps, social networking, utility, and then entertainment.</dd>
              
            <dt>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</dt>
               <dd>Games and Utilities</dd>
 
            <dt>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</dt>
               <dd>Games, Instant Messaging apps, and Entertainment app</dd>
 
            <dt>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</dt>
               <dd>More and more people are willing to pay for their entertainment above everything else (games!).</dd>

            <dt>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</dt>
            	<dd>USA, Japan and Great Britain combined seem to be about 11% using Ice Cream Sandwich, 2.4% Honeycomb, and about 64% using Gingerbread as of July 2012. I think that we need to develop where our apps run on the old software, and can scale up to the new versions as well, but run solidly on the old software.  source: developer.android.comnewmediatrendwatch.comguardian.co.uk</dd>

            <dt>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</dt>
            	<dd>USA - $3.33 / 1mbps :: source: telecompetitor.com
					Japan - $0.27 / 1mbps :: source gizmodo.com
					Great Britain - $3.00 / 1mbps :: source: infographic</dd>
					
				<dd>We need to consider how expensive it can be to deal with downloading/uploading a ton of data over a 3G/4G network. I think that we should work to have apps be as small as they can yet still provide the functionality we intend for it to.</dd>

            <dt>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</dt>
            	<dd>Right now I think my focus will be gaming first and productivity second.  I have a few ideas that I've been working on since I was about 11 years old, and they are still not around today (so I still have a chance to create it!). In terms of workload, the productivity app seems to be that it could be created much quicker than the game, so I'm not sure which one I want to do first. If you can design/create something that people enjoy, that's what you need to do. If you can make an app where your passions meet others' who are likewise passionate about what you've created, I think you can be very successful.</dd>
